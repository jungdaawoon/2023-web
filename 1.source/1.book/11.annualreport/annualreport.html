	<p class="title">Redesigning annual report.</p>
	<p>
	The reason we have a sense of crisis in the pollution problem is that environmental destruction hurts humans, not because it destroys the earth So, humans have to admit that they only care about humans, not the environment. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Likewise, many of the social and climate-related projects mentioned in the annual report serve as a means to promote the Institute itself and are not truly involved in solving the problem. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Here are many pages in the annual report to show off how many audiences participated, how many famous artists participated, and how many countries they have relationships with. I worked on the project under the assumption that the names of artists, countries, and institutions mentioned in the annual report were unnecessary decorations. 
	</p>
	<p>
	All these names replaced from main texts to cover. And The replaced places remain black in shape.
